# Rhythm Runner

Rhythm Runner was a game I developed for my final year of college in 2013. It was a rhythm game where you provide your own music to be analysed by the game where it would generate a level for you to play through. Think of a cross between BIT.TRIP RUNNER and AudioSurf.

It was written in C# using the now defunct Microsoft XNA Framework.

I open-sourced the project in 2020 and I might work on porting it to Unity/Something-Else for fun sometime.

Player character sprite not provided as I do not own it.
